# Sprites2Atlas

## What is it?
The purpose of Sprites2Atlas is to take the output format (.sprites file extension) generated by the sprite-sheet generation software darkFunction Editor (https://github.com/darkFunction/darkFunction-Editor) and convert it into the format used by libGDX (.atlas file extension).

## How do I install it?
You can download the .jar (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6608744/sprites2atlas.jar) and place that anywhere you like, on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.

## How do I use it?
Easy! Sprites2Atlas is a command-line tool with only two arguments, the input file path, and the desired output file path.  For example, `java -jar sprites2atlas.jar mygame.sprites mygame.atlas`.  After running that command, the .atlas file and the original sprite-sheet graphic can be placed in the assets folder of your libGDX project.
